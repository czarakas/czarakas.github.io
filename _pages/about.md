I am a [Schmidt Sciences Fellow](https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/) at [CarbonPlan](https://carbonplan.org/), with a joint appointment at the [University of California, Irvine](https://sites.uci.edu/randersonlab/). I am broadly interested in global-scale interactions between terrestrial ecosystems, climate, and society. I received my BA in Geosciences from Princeton University and my PhD in Atmospheric Sciences from the University of Washington, where I was a [DOE Computational Science Graduate Fellow](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/). Previously, I worked at a public sector consulting firm where I conducted research to inform climate mitigation and adaptation policies.
