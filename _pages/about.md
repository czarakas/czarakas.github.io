I am an Atmospheric Sciences PhD student and DOE Computational Science Graduate Fellow in the Ecoclimate Lab at the University of Washington. I am broadly interested in global-scale interactions between terrestrial ecosystems, land use, and climate. Prior to joining the Ecoclimate Lab, I worked at a public sector consulting firm where I conducted research to inform climate mitigation and adaptation policies. I graduated from Princeton University in 2016, where I was a NOAA Hollings Scholar and Geosciences major and focused on climate science, ecology, and biogeochemistry in my coursework and research.
