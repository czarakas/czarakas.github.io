I am a [Schmidt Sciences Fellow](https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/) at [CarbonPlan](https://carbonplan.org/), with a joint appointment at the University of California, Irvine. I completed my PhD in Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Washington, where I was a [DOE Computational Science Graduate Fellow](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/). I am broadly interested in global-scale interactions between terrestrial ecosystems, climate, and society. Previously, I worked at a public sector consulting firm where I conducted research to inform climate mitigation and adaptation policies. I graduated from Princeton University in 2016, where I was a NOAA Hollings Scholar and [Geosciences major](https://geosciences.princeton.edu/).
