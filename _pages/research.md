I am a climate scientist, and I study interactions between plants and the atmosphere. I am especially interested in understanding how plants respond to increasing CO<sub>2</sub> and climate change, and how those plant responses influence the Earth system by altering land energy and water fluxes. Climate models are the primary tool for much of my research - I run model experiments to learn about the mechanisms through which plants interact with the atmosphere, and I analyze climate model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) to explore the drivers of uncertainty across models. I also analyze ecological and atmospheric data at multiple spatial scales, from site-level observations to global-scale remote sensing products.
